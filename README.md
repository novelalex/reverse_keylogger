# Reverse Keylogger

I had the incredibly stupid idea of making a reverse keylogger, you know how a normal keylogger sends keystrokes from a target computer to the attackers computer? Well this does the opposite, it sends keystrokes from the attackers computer to the target computer. I have no idea why I made this, but I did. It recives get requests and then sends the keystrokes to the target computer. It's not very good, definitely not safe, and probably not very useful, but it works.
